# jinja-docsite

A docsite for the Ansible community to prototype new ideas for `docs.ansible.com`.
This docsite uses Jinja2 templates with HTML pages taken from the [ansible/docsite](https://github.com/ansible/docsite) repo.

The goal is to update the layout and navigation for users of the Ansible community documentation.
There are two aspects to this effort:

- Develop a persona-led approach to Ansible community documentation.
The intention is to lower the barrier to entry and make it easier for Ansible users to connect with information in the Ansible community.
You can find the [Ansible personas in HackMD](https://hackmd.io/pZb5w5JFRQW3RJ73n23tlw?view).

- Create a modern docsite for the Ansible community.

You can play around with the current version of this docsite prototype at: https://ansible.github.io/jinja-docsite/

## Join us!!

We want to hear from the Ansible community.
Let's build a new docsite together.

Do you like the general direction of this docsite but see room for improvement?

Do you think another implementation would be better for the Ansible community? Something that uses RST, another static site generator like [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/), or [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)?

Fork this repo and show us what you've got.
You can also head over to the [DaWGs](https://matrix.to/#/#docs:ansible.com) room and share your thoughts with the Ansible community on Matrix.
